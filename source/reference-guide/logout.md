# Logout From Gluu Server
Gluu Server offers single-logout(SLO) service for OpenID Connect

## OpenID Connect SLO
Gluu Server uses OpenID Connect to end session for logout. Usually a logout link is provided to the connected SP and the session is killed inside the IdP. When using the OpenId Connect Logout, it is recommened to test the _front channel logout_. In the _front channel logout_ the browser receives a page with the list of application logout urls each within an iframe. This causes the browser to call each applicaiton logout individually and finally calling the OpenID Connect end-session endpoint via _javascript_. Please see the [OpenID Connect Frontchannel Logout Specifications](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html) for more informaiton.

## SAML Logout
Although there is a SLO available for Shibboleth, it is not supported in Gluu Server because of its instabilities. Please take a look at [this page](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/CONCEPT/SLOIssues) for more information.

* The logout URI for SAML SP is `https://<hostname of Gluu Server>/idp/logout.jsp`<br/> Calling this URL within Gluu Server kills the session inside Gluu Server.

## Authentication Script
It is possible to use Custom Authentication Script to call individual logout methods for both SAML and OpenID Connect and log out of the desired SP/SPs when the user logs out of the Gluu Server. Please see the [Custom Script Guide](https://gluu.org/docs/customize/auth-script/) to start writing your own custom script.
